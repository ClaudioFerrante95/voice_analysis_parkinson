# Models

This directory is used to host the weights of pre-trained models.
These directories contain the checkpoints of the deep models that require wights to be locally available.
Refer to the following list to know which deep features model we used (N.B. not alla models require weights to be put here)

- [VGGish]()
- [SoundNet]()
